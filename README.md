# Word Game
This game is the program that I created for the first assessed assignment of my programming one module at university.
For this assignment we were given a set of rules that our code had to follow.
These rules were:

1. The first character of the next word should start with the last character of the
    previous word and they are case sensitive (for example, “Eat” and “eat” are
    different). For an invalid word, the game should continue with a message
    “Entered word is invalid or does not exist in the
    dictionary, please try again”.
2. The word must not be entered in the game before. The game must be
    terminated if any word is repeated with a message “Game over”.
3. The word should have only the alphanumeric characters (such as [A-Z] and [a
    to z]), and should not have any numeric character (such as numbers 4 or 7) or
    space or hyphenated (such as co-worker) or special characters (such as ; ,
    :) within itself. For an invalid word, the game should continue with a message
   “Entered word is invalid or does not exist in the
    dictionary, please try again”.
4. The word should be a valid word existing in the dictionary. Use the attached
    dictionary.zip (containing dictionary.txt) file as the dictionary. For an invalid
    word, the game should continue with a message “Entered word is
    invalid or does not exist in the dictionary, please
    try again”.
5. If nothing is entered by the user (empty string or word with length 0), the
    game must restart from the beginning
    
Our professor also wanted us to include certain methods:

1. gameStart: this should check all the necessary conditions inside.
2. wordValid: this should check the existence of the word in the dictionary.
3. gameRestart: should make the program start looping again. 


This project shows what I have picked up after just over two months of learning Java.
